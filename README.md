# xflux-gui snap

## About

f.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the time.
When the sun sets, it makes your computer look like your indoor lights.
In the morning, it makes things look like sunlight again.

The f.lux indicator applet `fluxgui` is an indicator applet to control `xflux`

NOTE: This snap does not work with mir, only with x11

## Note

Currently the gui does not work.
Instead use `fluxgui.xflux` to run xflux directly.

## ToDo
 - [ ] ~~Compile xflux from the source~~ (currently isn't open source)
 - [ ] Fix dbus
